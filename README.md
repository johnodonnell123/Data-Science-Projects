# John ODonnell - Project Portfolio

## Index:

This is a repository to organize and share my personal data science projects! You can also find this information on my [GitHub Webpage](https://johnodonnell123.github.io)

1. [Scraping, Storing, and Visualizing Oil Well Production Data](https://github.com/johnyo/PersonalProjects)
    - This is a general overview of my project, I expand on many aspects of it in the items below:
      - Web Scraping with Scrapy Spiders to SQLite3
      - SQL and Pandas
      - Data Visualization with Plotly

## Background

Howdy! 

My name is John ODonnell and I would like to briefly introduce myself! Most of my formal education has been in geoscience, and for the past ~3 years I have worked as a geoscientist for a Houston based oil and gas company. As a geoscientist I was tasked with understanding how to relate the properties of geologic reservoirs to the performance of the wells attempting to drain them. I worked with large multidisciplinary datasets that are full of noise, uncertainty, and bias. Using traditional Data Science techniques, I was able to draw meaningful conclusions and reveal impactful relationships hidden within these complex datasets. I used Python daily for data analysis, data visualizaiton, and I have built countless machine learning models that I plan to share here with you! Cards on the table, this is an environment for my to highlight my skillset as I search for my next opportunity, but I also hope to receive contstructive criticism and maybe help a person or two learn something along the way. 

Most of my projects will be using datasets from the Oil and Gas domain, as this is where my expertise is currently the strongest. My hope is to explain these projects and concepts in a way that is clear, informative, and exciting.
