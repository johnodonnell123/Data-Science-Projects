# Using SQL and Plotly in Python to explore production data in the Williston Basin of North Dakota

## Useful Information

Enclosed is a Jupyter Notebook with all of the SQL statements and the functions I used to plot the production. I cannot provide the raw dataset as it is dervied from a website with a paid subscription, however I do cover the project where I scraped this data [here](https://github.com/johnodonnell123/Personal_Projects/tree/master/Scraping%20Oil%20Production%20with%20Scrapy). A more thorough walkthrough can be found [here](https://johnodonnell123.github.io/pages/page_EDA.html).
